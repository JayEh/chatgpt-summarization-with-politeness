The analysis is based on a dataset of Long Prompts, Neutral Responses, and Polite Responses. The results indicate that longer input prompts generally result in longer summaries, and polite summarizations tend to be longer than neutral summarizations. Furthermore, the addition of politeness is associated with longer summaries compared to neutral summarizations, and this relationship is statistically significant. The study also explores the similarity between the generated summaries and the original prompts, the sentiment consistency, and the semantic content preservation. The findings provide valuable insights into the impact of politeness on the summarization process and can inform the development of natural language summarization systems.

## 1. Introduction
Automatic text summarization is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to generate concise and informative summaries of longer texts. With the increasing amount of textual data available, the demand for efficient and accurate summarization systems has grown significantly. One aspect of summarization that has received less attention is the incorporation of politeness in the generated summaries. Politeness can play a crucial role in enhancing the readability and acceptability of summaries, especially in contexts where the target audience values politeness or when the content deals with sensitive topics.

This study investigates the relationship between the length of input prompts and the length of generated summaries, as well as the impact of incorporating politeness on summarization length and quality. The analysis is based on a dataset of Long Prompts, Neutral Responses, and Polite Responses, generated using two sets of summarization instructions: Neutral Instructions and Polite Instructions.

Neutral Instructions:
```
Summarize the following document/statement, between triple backticks (```), as shortly as possible. 
Ensuring that the summary:
1. Captures the main ideas and key points of the original text.
2. Is concise and significantly shorter than the original text, without losing essential information.
3. Maintains the original meaning and accurately represents the content.
4. Is written in clear, coherent, and grammatically correct language.
5. Avoids including any opinions, interpretations, or additional information not found in the original text.
6. Preserves the tone (neutral, positive, or negative) of the original text, if applicable.
